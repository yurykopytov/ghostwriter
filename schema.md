America is not coming to save Europe this time.

That is the clear message of two landmark speeches from the past week — one by U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the other by the Vice President JD Vance. Hegseth, speaking at a summit in Brussels on February 12th, declared that Europe is no longer America’s primary security focus:

We're…here today to directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe…The United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must – and we are – focusing on security of our own borders…We also face a peer competitor in the Communist Chinese with the capability and intent to threaten our homeland and core national interests in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing tradeoffs to ensure deterrence does not fail…Deterrence cannot fail, for all of our sakes…As the United States prioritizes its attention to these threats, European allies must lead from the front…Together, we can establish a division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and Pacific respectively. [emphasis mine]

Hegseth also warned that the U.S. will eventually pull its troops out of Europe, and said that Europe must provide the vast majority of support for Ukraine going forward.

Two days later, at the Munich Security Conference, Vance argued that Europe’s biggest threat was not Russia or China, but what he perceives as a slide toward anti-democratic values:

[T]he threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor…[W]hat I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.

As evidence of Europe’s retreat from democracy, he cited Romania’s cancellation of an election result due to supposed election interference, Sweden’s jailing of a rightist activist for burning a Koran, and Britain’s arrest of an anti-abortion activist for silently praying near an abortion clinic. He also urged European governments to spend more on defense, and to listen to their citizens who are upset about recent waves of immigration.

Now, there are two very different ways you can interpret these speeches, but they both lead to the same basic conclusion.

The first interpretation is that Hegseth and Vance are telling Europe hard truths that it needs to hear. After all, even if America wants to be the guarantor of European security as it was in the Cold War and the World Wars, it can’t be — at least, not if it wants to be the guarantor of security in Asia, where its most formidable foe looms. China dramatically overmatches America in terms of manufacturing capability, has four times America’s population, and is a peer in terms of technology. Even with Japan, India, Korea, Australia, and other allies fully on board, America would be desperately hard-pressed to withstand a concerted Chinese attempt to take over Asia.

Stretched by decades of deindustrialization and smothered in layers of lawsuits and regulations, America is not the arsenal of democracy it once was. It has no choice but to prioritize. Asia is more economically important to the U.S., and China is a much bigger long-term threat to the U.S. than Russia is. Thus, it’s simply inevitable that America will have to turn towards Asia and away from Europe and the Middle East.

Meanwhile, Vance has a point about European values. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights claims to protect freedom of expression, as does the UK’s Human Rights Act of 1998. The laws that criminalize burning the Koran and praying near an abortion clinic definitely seem to go against the principle of free expression. And even though Russia interfered in Romania’s election, annulling an election sets a dangerous precedent, because it’s always pretty easy to claim foreign interference if you’re an unscrupulous autocrat.

So it’s possible that Hegseth and Vance are not only being sincere, but are giving Europe a needed wake-up call.

The second interpretation is that Hegseth and Vance are being disingenuous. According to this narrative, the MAGA movement admires and is closely aligned with Russia. Trump draws a false moral equivalence between Russia and Ukraine, unfairly laying some of the blame on Ukraine for the war. Russia has always favored Trump over his rivals, whether or not their support has been materially important; Trump tends to like people who support him. And many on the American right see Russia (wrongly) as a supporter of traditional Christian and masculine values, unlike the Europeans, who they see as godless deracinated socialists. So perhaps Trump and his people simply want Russia to prevail over Ukraine.

When Hegseth says America needs to divert resources toward securing its own borders, he’s obviously blowing smoke — even quadrupling the amount America spends on border security (just $7.3 billion in 2024 despite years of big increases) would leave it far smaller than Ukraine aid. And it’s a bit rich for JD Vance to criticize Romania for annulling an election, when he supports Trump’s effort to do something extremely similar back in 2020.

In this interpretation, everything Trump’s people are saying is simply an extension of right-wing culture-war politics — their concern for free speech is a fig leaf, they like European far-right parties because they’re anti-immigration, and they want to switch America’s foreign policy back to isolationism and the Western Hemisphere.

I’m a bit agnostic as to which of these interpretations is correct. My instinct is that Hegseth is being sincere, while Vance is probably playing to his domestic political base in the U.S. And I think the Trump administration probably contains a fair number of both right-wing isolationists who want America to withdraw from the world and focus all its energy on internal ideological conflicts, and conservative internationalists who recognize the magnitude of the threat from China.

But more importantly, I think that from Europe’s vantage point, it mostly doesn’t matter which interpretation of America’s recent words and actions is more accurate.

Whether America really wants to focus on deterring China in Asia, or whether it just wants to retreat from the global stage and focus on bullying Canada, Panama, and its own minorities, that doesn’t change the cold hard fact that America is retreating from its role as the guarantor of European security. And whether or not Trump’s people actually think Russia is a threat to Europe, that doesn’t change the fact that Russia is a threat to Europe. And whether Trump’s people truly care about free speech, that doesn’t change the fact that Europe’s people are angry about recent immigration waves, and if that anger isn’t accommodated through the democratic process, Europe’s stability could be in danger.

In other words, both the challenges that Europe faces, and the fact that the U.S. is not going to help with those challenges, are clear and obvious. Europe must either stand on its own against the threats that face it, or capitulate to those threats.

Fortunately, some of the Europeans may finally be realizing this. Benjamin Tallis has an excellent thread in which he argues that although it’s bad that the U.S. is withdrawing its protection, Hegseth is essentially right that Europe needs to step up and fill the void that the U.S. is leaving. Ukraine’s President Zelensky has been saying similar things. And France’s President Macron has called an emergency EU summit to discuss America’s withdrawal from the region.

And fortunately, Europe has the fundamental strength required to defeat the threats it faces, even without America’s help.
