The ancient Greek concept of **parrhesia**—the courageous, public truth-telling that shapes reality—captures a unique power possessed by founders. Parrhesia isn’t just about having the freedom to speak, but about wielding speech that is bold, transformative, and rooted in deep personal conviction. In antiquity, it was a defining feature of philosophers, generals, and orators, whose words could rally societies, confront power, and catalyze change. Foucault’s analysis highlights that parrhesia requires moral courage; it’s not just about voicing opinions, but doing so at personal risk, challenging norms, and inciting others to collective action. In this sense, parrhesia becomes a vital source of civic life, the spark that pushes others out of apathy and into engagement.

This principle aligns closely with the so-called **“founder mode”** of leadership. Founders possess an irreplaceable, moral authority—“it’s their baby”—that enables them to speak and act with a candor and urgency that is almost impossible for any later executive or manager to replicate. In founder mode, leadership is hands-on, direct, and deeply personal, unconstrained by short-term incentives or committee caution. Founders can deliver bold truths—parrhesia—about the company’s mission, values, and direction because they alone carry the legitimacy and skin in the game to do so. No one else can offer the same degree of radical honesty and risk-taking speech. Yet, as with the ancient orators, this mode is not just about heroics; for organizations to thrive, founders must also foster teamwork, blend their vision with disciplined management, and inspire others to embrace parrhesia themselves—creating a culture where courageous, mission-driven truth-telling becomes a shared ideal, not a solitary act.

Parrhesia can be described as follows by Michel Foucault:

- Parrhesia is an ancient Greek word meaning publicity, the right to speak publicly.
- It roughly corresponds to the notion of freedom of speech, that is, the right to speak publicly and be heard.
- In antiquity, parrhesia was a principle that created reality.
- According to Foucault, a courageous person possesses parrhesia. This means that they are not afraid to tell their contemporaries what they think.
- As a result of such speech, courage is transmitted to others, and thus, speech changes reality. The ancient orator knew how to activate these mechanisms of changing reality through words.
- Parrhesia in antiquity was a universal ideal. It was implied that both a well-read philosopher and a general possessed this parrhesia, meaning they could speak boldly. The source notes that Hollywood films inherited from antiquity and rhetoric the idea that a hero does not become a true hero until they deliver some bold, key, programmatic speech at a climactic moment, and this speech affects the state of civil society.
- According to Foucault, parrhesia, or bold speech, is often driven by emotions, such as anger. Nevertheless, it creates civic life, leading people to start discussing certain issues together and eventually developing civil society.
- In his later works, Foucault systematically explores the history of parrhesia.
- The source also links Foucault's own courage, his willingness to confront the police and even be arrested, to the concept of parrhesia, viewing this as a kind of manifestation of parrhesia or care for one's own body.

Founder mode  can be described as follows by Brian Chesky:

Founder-mode and manager-mode describe two contrasting leadership styles rooted in different sources of authority, time horizons, and decision-making approaches. In “manager-mode,” which reflects the conventional wisdom taught at business schools, leaders focus on delegation, empowerment, and avoiding micromanagement. They hire talented executives, establish clear goals and metrics, and hold their teams accountable for results. Professional managers operate with a relatively short time horizon—typically measured in quarters—and understand that their tenure can be limited: boards may replace them if performance stalls.

By contrast, “founder-mode” celebrates the founder’s deep moral authority over the business—after all, it’s “their baby.” Founders are seen as irreplaceable, with no “sell-by” date, and therefore think in years or even eras rather than quarters. They embrace a hands-on approach, diving into every operational detail, questioning executives they view as potentially “value-destroying,” and personally steering critical projects. Founder-mode elevates mission over role, asking everyone to wear multiple hats and take on ownership far beyond a traditional job description.

David Kellogg’s central argument is that these two modes are not interchangeable, nor is one inherently superior. As someone who has served as both a C-level executive and a startup CEO (but never an original founder), he highlights three core insights:

1. “We Are Not the Same.”
    
    Founders possess moral authority and a long runway that professional managers lack. Recognizing this distinction explains why founders often default to a more hands-on style.
    
2. Beware of Straw Men.
    
    Kellogg argues that most critiques of manager-mode exaggerate business-school dogma. B-schools teach executives to “listen bottom-up, direct top-down,” to distinguish delegation from abdication, and to use metrics intelligently rather than micromanaging every detail.
    
3. Teamwork Trumps Heroics.
    
    Relying solely on founder heroism risks sidelining proven management practices and stifling collaboration. Kellogg points to Crew Resource Management in aviation—where teams communicate and coordinate closely—as a model for how organizations achieve better outcomes than when a lone “pilot” founder tries to do everything.
    

Kellogg also cites empirical research involving 122 founders and extensive 360° feedback that finds little evidence for the sweeping benefits often claimed by founder-mode advocates. His bottom line: it’s seductive to imagine the charismatic founder grabbing the yoke and driving the plane alone, but sustainable success depends on blending founders’ passion and vision with disciplined delegation, accountability, and strong, collaborative teams.
