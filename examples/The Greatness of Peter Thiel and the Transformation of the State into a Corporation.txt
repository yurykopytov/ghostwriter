 **The Greatness of Peter Thiel and the Transformation of the State into a Corporation**

The idea that transnational corporations will eventually turn into states has been circulating in society for a long time. Even as a university student studying corporate governance, I heard about this concept. Globalism and the growing influence of transnational corporations were actively discussed even then.

**Corporations as the Managers of the World**
Transnational corporations indeed have a huge impact on the global economy. They directly affect the GDP of countries, unemployment levels, the share of employed individuals, and other important economic indicators. However, the idea of corporations as independent states is not new. It has been forming long before the 2000s, when I first encountered this notion.

But if we delve deeper into this issue, it becomes clear that behind any transnational corporation, there are always national elites. Volkswagen is linked to German businessmen, Google to American founders, and the largest Chinese corporations are invariably backed by the Communist Party of China. Thus, transnational corporations are more a form of doing business than independent state structures.

**The State as a Corporation**
Today, in 2025, we are witnessing not so much the transformation of corporations into states as the transformation of states into corporations. Politicians and businessmen like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Marc Andreessen increasingly think of the state in terms of corporate governance. What once seemed impossible has now become a reality.

The state acts like a business unit, with strict requirements for deals and negotiations. Look at how Trump negotiates tariffs and duties or about Ukraine's natural resources. Power is becoming a corporate structure, and the president acts more like a CEO, unconcerned about the opinions of subordinates. He manages the country as he sees fit, focusing on strategic goals rather than social obligations.

**The Power of Technological Oligarchs**
Today, there is a sense that the "shares" of states belong to technological oligarchs who manage them according to business laws. Bloggers and ideologists, such as followers of the "dark enlightenment" concept, propose a fully corporate model of state governance, where the interests of minorities take a back seat. However, the refusal to protect all citizens of the state carries dangerous consequences. History shows that such a path leads to authoritarian regimes, where dissent becomes undesirable.

**Peter Thiel's Ideas**
Peter Thiel stands at the forefront of a new business-political agenda. In his work, he argues that competition is for losers. In his view, the only right path is the creation of monopolies, as only they can bring real benefits to society. A monopoly allows for setting rules, controlling the market, and lowering prices in the long term.

These ideas have found reflection in American politics. The Vice President of the United States is a protégé of Thiel, and his former colleagues hold key positions. The concept of eliminating competition and absorbing rivals is now not only a business approach but also a strategy of the American administration. The U.S. behaves on the world stage like a corporation, eliminating weak players and refusing to cooperate with weaker allies, such as the European Union.

In other words, the American administration, like a company, fights for all possible markets, destroys the weak, and has no intention of solidarity, as seen in its policy towards Europe. Europe is weak; we do not need it. We do not intend to deal with it.

**The State as a Global Market**
Today, the boundaries between the state and the corporation are blurring. Perhaps states themselves have become transnational corporations with national elites at the helm. If this is the case, we should reconsider our conventional understanding of power, economics, and democracy in this new corporate world.
