# Unraveling Androgynous General Intelligence: Soviet Cybernetic Culture and the Machines of Sexuation

In a small, dimly lit room in Moscow, around mid-20th century, a group of Soviet intellectuals gathered to discuss something revolutionary: the possibility of creating a 'thinking machine.' Ewald Ilyenkov and his colleagues pondered the complexities of sexual differentiation and gendered desire, which they believed presented an insurmountable barrier to achieving what we now know as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). These discussions, documented in "The Machine and the Human, Cybernetics and Philosophy," provide a fascinating glimpse into the intersection of technology and sexuality within Soviet cybernetic culture.

The Soviet Union, amidst its ambitions to lead the world in scientific and technological advancements, saw cybernetics not merely as a tool but as a philosophical endeavor. However, as reflected in Ilyenkov's work, the Soviet cybernetic project was laden with ideological battles. The very notion of creating a machine with human-like intelligence was entangled with the debate of whether such intelligence could exist without a human-like, gendered and sexed body—a debate that has only grown more relevant in today's discussions about AI.

The crux of Ilyenkov's argument lies in the critique of a depoliticized image of intelligence as a self-contained computational system. This idea, he argued, mirrors a capitalist perspective that reduces intelligence to a commodity, ignoring the socio-cultural fabric that shapes human cognition. Ilyenkov's Spinozian-Marxist-Vygotskian approach emphasizes the necessity of a human-like societal context for human-like intelligence to emerge. The human-like body, gendered and sexed, is not just a vessel but a crucial participant in the emergence of intelligence.

This perspective offers a stark contrast to the Western view of AGI, often perceived through a lens of technological determinism, where intelligence is reduced to algorithms and neural networks. Ilyenkov and his colleagues, in their somewhat rhetorical yet profound critique, foresaw the dangers of such reductionism—a foresight that resonates with contemporary critiques in AI ethics and cyberfeminism.

The discussions in the Soviet context were not merely theoretical. They were deeply embedded in the cultural and political milieu of the time. Soviet literature and art of the era, with figures like Andrei Platonov and Pavel Filonov, grappled with the concept of the androgynous body—a phantasm that symbolized the breaking of traditional gender binaries. Platonov's works, for instance, often depicted a world where human emotions and mechanical precision coexisted, highlighting the tensions between the organic and the mechanical, the gendered and the gender-neutral.

The cybernetic physiologists and psychologists of the Soviet Union, whom Ilyenkov's essay directly disputes, were proponents of a vision where machines could transcend human limitations. Yet, Ilyenkov's critique warned against a future where machines, stripped of human context, served only the machine of capital. This debate, deeply rooted in Soviet thought, anticipated the later emergence of cyberfeminism, which challenged the patriarchal structures embedded within technology and sought to reimagine the role of gender in the digital age.

In reconstructing the epistemological, political, and cultural context of Ilyenkov's claims, we find a rich tapestry of ideas that challenge our current understanding of AGI. The Soviet cybernetic culture, with its unique blend of Marxism and scientific inquiry, provides a critical lens through which to examine the socio-political underpinnings of technological advancements.

As we stand on the brink of new developments in AI, revisiting these debates is not just an academic exercise but a necessary reflection on the values we embed in our technologies. The Soviet discourse on the androgynous body and the machines of sexuation reminds us that the quest for AGI is not merely a technical challenge but a deeply human one, rooted in our understanding of identity, culture, and society.

In today's world, where AI is increasingly shaping the fabric of our lives, Ilyenkov's insights urge us to consider the broader implications of our technological pursuits. As we build machines that think, we must also ask: what kind of society do we want these machines to reflect? The answer, perhaps, lies not just in the code we write but in the cultural narratives we choose to uphold.
