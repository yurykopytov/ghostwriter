The 21st century has revealed a striking paradox at the heart of American power: while political leaders rail against “globalism” (globalist has become the worst claim) and promise to put their nation first, the administration’s most influential companies—tech bros—are fundamentally global actors. This tension creates a fascinating and unstable alliance, as Silicon Valley visionaries who support nationalist leaders soon discover that the populist policies they enabled can threaten their own worldwide ambitions.

Unlike the business titans of the past, such as the car industry or oil markets, whose empires were limited by national borders, today’s tech giants—Google, Meta, and Apple—are designed to conquer international markets from from “day one” (Amazon). Their reach is not limited to any one country; for them, the world itself is the only meaningful playing field. Yet this global dominance puts them on a collision course with governments desperate to regain control, sparking debates over regulation, sovereignty, and the very definition of national interest.

As tech companies accumulate unprecedented economic and political power, we are forced to confront unsettling questions: Who truly governs in the digital age—the elected officials, or the private empires that shape what billions see, say, and buy? Can governments effectively rein in these companies without stifling innovation, or will the most ambitious tech leaders eventually seek roles traditionally reserved for states? In this new era, the competition is not just between nations, but between different visions of who should lead—and how far their power should reach.
