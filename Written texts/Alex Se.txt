Alexey Sebyakin is a contemporary artist who creates objects, installations, sculptures, and video art. He is active today, and his techniques and motives reflect craftsmanship, particularly handmade work from the mid-20th century, influenced by material experiments.

His work embodies the classical style of Arte Povera, which translates to "poor art." It's important to clarify that Arte Povera is not merely trash found on the street, although that can occur. Arte Povera involves non-artistic materials or objects that collectively form a work of art.

These are not ready-made objects like readymades or even pop art. Instead, they consist of materials, such as cement, from which new "poor art" emerges. Artists have expanded the boundaries of art; they no longer require traditional canvases and paints; anything can serve as a medium. Alexey Sebyakin operates within this genre, which is evident in his work.

Raised in a specific postmodern tradition, his art explores the concept of post-pop art. But what does "post" signify in this context?

"Post" does not imply that Alexey Sebyakin has replaced pop art or that he merely exploits its ideas. The key point is that while pop artists showcase everyday objects in ordinary or extraordinary settings—objects whose significance we recognize in daily life—post-pop art presents objects that seem to replicate real things but do not actually exist. You may find the images familiar, yet you realize that such objects do not exist in the everyday world.

This creates a simulacrum of reality. In this sense, Sebyakin's works—whether photographs, objects, or still lifes—always represent something else. You understand that this is neither a still life, a photograph, nor a bag of trash designed to resemble an object.

It refers to these things but is not them. Your consciousness reconstructs the belonging of this object.

In reality, it does not exist anywhere—neither in our everyday life nor even in artificial reality.

Why does it not exist even in artificial reality? Because it is grounded in our physical world made of atoms.

Alexey Sebyakin's approach and the entire optics of his art are built on these two poles, these two vectors. This emphatic statement is intentional. As technology develops, we must continually clarify where we are and what we see.
