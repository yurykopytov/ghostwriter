Agile as "pragmatic deconstruction": unexpected parallels between flexible methodologies and French theory

This article reveals an original idea about the deep similarities between the Agile approach in project management and the philosophical principles of French theory (especially the approach of Jacques Derrida).

The central parallel is the rejection of the traditional perception of a task as a clearly formulated condition that requires a definite and final solution. Instead, both Agile and French philosophy propose a continuous process of rethinking and refining the initial question. For example, in traditional software development (the "waterfall model"), the question "what are we doing?" has a clear answer in the form of a comprehensive technical specification, whereas in Agile, this question is constantly refined and evolves through regular meetings and discussions with the team and the client. Just as Derrida writes, considering sign and meaning, French philosophy does not rush to close the task with a clear answer. Instead, it asks: "What is a sign?", "What is the field of its meanings?", "What assumptions underlie the question itself?". Thus, Agile can be interpreted as a methodology that applies the principles of deconstruction to project management.

Another aspect of similarity is the reaction of traditionalists to these approaches. Derrida noted that his way of posing questions irritated representatives of Anglo-American philosophy, who expected "elegant solutions" and "proven theorems". Similarly, the Agile approach encounters resistance among managers accustomed to clear plans and the immutability of technical specifications. In both cases, the criticism sounds similar: Agile is accused of "chaos," while French theory is criticized for "ambiguity." In reality, both are related to the rejection of the traditional model, where tasks are simply "solved," instead of constantly refining their meaning and value.

The aspect of communication is also important. The French educational model, established by the Convention and affirmed by Napoleon, was built around the ability of a person to argue, articulate, and defend their ideas both in writing and orally. In the French system, the standard is embodied in the person, rather than simply described in a document. Similar ideas were observed in the Russian philosophical and literary tradition of the 19th century, where the written culture of argumentation became a tool for deep reflection and rethinking of socio-philosophical questions. In modern business, an example of this culture is Amazon with their famous PRD (Product Requirements Document), where each idea and solution is carefully argued in writing and discussed only after being read by all meeting participants. Similarly, Basecamp fosters a culture of written communication in projects, believing that written discussions contribute to a deeper understanding of tasks and goals, reducing the need for constant meetings and oral clarifications.

These parallels allow us to see Agile not only as a management tool but also as a practical application of philosophical ideas similar to those of French deconstruction. This perspective may shed new light on why Agile is so successful in adaptive, creative environments but faces resistance in rigid and formalized organizations.
