cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your credentials:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key
# - NOTION_TOKEN: Your Notion integration token (optional)
# - NOTION_DATABASE_ID: Your Notion database ID (optional)
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Run the ghostwriter application:

```bash
python ghostwriter_app.py
```

The application will:
1. Read your article idea from `idea.txt`
2. Generate an initial article draft
3. Enter interactive mode for refinement

In interactive mode, you can:
- Request revisions or improvements
- Add specific details or sections
- Adjust tone or style
- Type `exit` or `quit` to finish

### Web Interface

Launch the web interface:

```bash
# Open web/index.html in your browser
# Or use a local server:
cd web
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Input Format

Create or edit `idea.txt` with your article topic:

```text
Your article idea or topic goes here. It can be a simple concept,
a question you want to explore, or a brief outline of what you'd
like to write about.
```

## Configuration

### OpenAI Settings

The application uses GPT-5-turbo model by default. You can modify the model and parameters in `ghostwriter_app.py`:

```python
model="gpt-5-turbo"  # Or gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.
```

### Notion Integration Setup

To enable automatic article saving to Notion:

1. **Create a Notion Integration**:
   - Visit https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   - Click "New integration"
   - Name it (e.g., "Ghostwriter Agent")
   - Copy the integration token

2. **Create a Notion Database**:
   - Create a new database in your Notion workspace
   - Add these properties:
     - `Title` (Title type)
     - `Status` (Select type: Generated, Draft, Published)
     - `Created` (Date type)
   - Copy the database ID from the URL

3. **Connect Integration to Database**:
   - In your database, click "..." menu → "Connect to"
   - Select your integration

4. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   NOTION_TOKEN=your_integration_token_here
   NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
   ```

### System Prompt Customization

Modify `system_prompt.md` to adjust the AI's writing style, tone, and behavior. The prompt defines:
- Article length requirements
- Citation standards
- Narrative style guidelines
- Personal anecdote usage

## How It Works

1. **System Prompt Loading**: The application loads comprehensive writing instructions from `system_prompt.md`
2. **Idea Processing**: Reads the article topic from `idea.txt`
3. **Article Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate a complete article with:
   - Engaging narrative style
   - Personal anecdotes
   - Proper citations and references
   - 1-3 A4 pages of content
4. **Interactive Refinement**: Allows iterative improvements through conversational commands
5. **Auto-Save**: Optionally saves completed articles to Notion database

## Writing Style

The AI Ghostwriter specializes in:
- **Narrative journalism** with first-person perspective
- **Well-researched content** with mandatory citations
- **Personal storytelling** that feels authentic and relatable
- **Modern, engaging tone** suitable for Medium and Substack
- **Balanced coverage** with nuanced analysis

## API Costs

The application uses OpenAI's API which incurs costs based on:
- Model used (GPT-5-turbo, GPT-4, etc.)
- Input and output tokens
- Number of iterations/refinements

Typical cost per article: $0.10 - $1.00 depending on length and iterations.
